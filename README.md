# Example of Triangle Arbitrage

To make things simpler we will use traditional currencies as an example.

- Imagine you have $1 million, and these are the following conversion rates.

**These conversion rates are for sake of example.**

- USD/EURO : 1.02
- EURO/YUAN : 6.71
- USD/YUAN: 6.83

**Trade 1**
Sell USD to buy Euros

1,000,000 \* 1.02 = 1,020,000 Euros

**Trade 2**
Sell Euros to buy Yuan

1,020,000 \* 6.71 = 6,844,200 Yuan

**Trade 3**
Sell Yuan to buy USD

6,844,200 \* 6.83 = 1,002,079 USD

**Total Returns**
Start Balance: 1,000,000
End Balance: 1,002,079
Profit: 2,079
Return: 0.2079%
